# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction-Using-XGBoosting
This project uses XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to detect Parkinson’s disease from biomedical voice or sensor data. By analyzing features like vocal frequency, amplitude, and jitter, the model classifies patients with high accuracy, enabling early diagnosis &amp; improving treatment planning for Parkinson’s disease detection.
